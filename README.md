# vba-challenge

Using Excel VBA scripting to analyze data from stock market data.

The use of Stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62471422/vba-loop-how-to-get-ticker-symbols-into-ticker-column was used
for assistance with getting the ticker symbol and looping set up.

For the VBA script created, it did run without any noticeable errors, but on both the testing workbook and the final workbook the macro seemed to stop
midway through.
